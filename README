These are functions that can be composed together to check the equivalence of firewalls.

To run anything with KLEE, use their docker image.

To get into the docker image

    docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/home/klee/workspace klee/klee

then navigate to where the code is (will be inside a directory called workspace). you will need to install some extra packages with the little install.sh script

    ./install.sh

then run the python script to get the SMT formulas

    python3 index.py

This should print out SMT formulas for each path. Eventually, it should give us one big SMT formula that describes the whole firewall
